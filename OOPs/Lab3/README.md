# Lab exercises:
1.	Write a program to compute whether a no . is an Armstrong number or not. Use any of the iteration statements.

2.	Write a Java program to display the numbers in the following format 
- 	using nested for loop.
- 	using for-each loop.
&nbsp;1\
&nbsp;2 2\
&nbsp;3 3 3\
&nbsp;4 4 4 4\
&nbsp;5 5 5 5 5\

3.	Write a Java program to generate prime numbers between n and m.(Hint: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Eg: 2, 3, 5,7,11 etc.)

4.	Write  a java program to search for a value in a 1 dimensional array using for each loop construct. Assume that the array is initialized at the time of declaration and user enters the value to be searched on request.(1 mark)
- Input:     a[]={1,2,3,1,2,1,5,6,7}   searchValue= 1
- Expected Output : The value is found at locations:   a[0] ,a[3],a[5]   .

- Case 1: Duplication of digit is allowed.
- Case 2: Duplication of digit is not allowed.

2.	Write a Java programs to evaluate the following series
- 	Sin(x) =x - (x3/3!) + (x5/5!)-…
- 	Sum=1 + (1/2)2 + (1/3)3 +…
