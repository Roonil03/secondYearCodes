# Lab exercises
1. Create a class Box that uses a parameterized method to initialize the dimensions of a box. (dimensions are width, height, depth of double type). The class should have a method that can return volume. Obtain an object and print the corresponding volume in main() function.
2.	Define a class Employee with data members: employee name, city, basic salary, dearness allowance (DA%) and house rent (HRA%). Define getdata(), calculate(), and display() functions. Calculate method should find the total salary and display method should display it.\
Total = basic + basic x da / 100 + basic x hra / 100;
3.	Create a Time class that has separate integer member data for hours, minutes and seconds. One constructor should initialize these data to zero and another should initialize to fixed value. A method should display time in hh:mm:ss format. Finally a method should add 2 objects of time passed as argument. 
4.	Create a complex class. Use method overloading to find the sum.\
add(integer, complex number)\
add(complex number, complex number)
5.	Create class Number with only one private instance variable as a double primitive type. Include the following methods (include respective constructors) isZero( ), isPositive(), isNegative( ), isOdd( ), isEven( ), isPrime(), isArmstrong(). The above methods return boolean primitive type.
6.	Write a program to define a class called Book with title,author and edition fields.  Define suitable constructors for the Book class. Create a list of 6 Book objects in ascending order.  Display only those booksâ€™ details written by an author taken as an user input.

# Additional exercises:
1. Create a class Result with 2D array and 1D array as its data members. And write methods to perform the following tasks:-
- Store marks of 3 subjects obtained by 3 students in 2D array
- To store total marks obtained by each student in 1D array.
- To find the highest marks in each subject and the roll number of the student who secured it.
- To find the student who obtained the highest total marks. <br><br>
2. Create a class with integer array of size 10 and write methods to perform following:-
- Input values into an array
- Display the values
- Display the largest value
- Display the average
- Sort the array in ascending order <br><br>
