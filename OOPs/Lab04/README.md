# Lab exercises:
1. Write a Java program to display non diagonal elements and find their sum. [Hint: Non Principal diagonal: The diagonal of a diagonal matrix from the top right to the bottom left corner is called non principal diagonal.]
2. Write a Java program to display principal diagonal elements and find their sum. [Hint: Principal Diagonal: The principal diagonal of a rectangular matrix is the diagonal which runs from the top left corner and steps down and right, until the right edge or the bottom edge is reached].
3. Find whether a given matrix is symmetric or not. [Hint: A = AT]
4. Write a program to add and multiply two integer matrices. The algorithm for matrix multiplications are given below:
- To multiply two matrixes sufficient and necessary condition is "number of columns in matrix A = number of rows in matrix B".
- Loop for each row in matrix A.
- Loop for each columns in matrix B and initialize output matrix C to 0. 
- This loop will run for each rows of matrix A.
- Loop for each columns in matrix A.
- Multiply A[i,k] to B[k,j] and add this value to C[i,j]
- Return output matrix C.
5. Write a Java program to find whether the matrix is a magic square or not. [Hint: Compare the sum for every row, the sum with every column, the sum of the principal diagonal and the sum of the non-principal diagonal elements. If they are all same, then the matrix is a magic square matrix].

1.	Print all the prime numbers in a given 1D array.
2.	Find the largest and smallest element in 1D array.
3.	Search for an element in a given matrix and count the number of its occurrences.
4.	Write a program to merge two arrays in third array. Also sort the third array in ascending order.
5.	Find the trace and norm of a given square matrix. [Hint: Trace= sum of principal diagonal elements; Norm= Sqrt(sum of squares of the individual elements of an array)]
