#  Lab Exercises:
 1. Write two separate C programs (one for server and other for client) using socket APIs for TCP, to implement the client-server model such that the client should send a set of integers along with a choice to search for a number or sort the given set in ascending/descending order or split the given set to odd and even to the server. The server performs the relevant operation according to the choice. Client should continue to send the messages until the user enters selects the choice “exit”.
 2. Write two separate C programs (one for server and other for client) using UNIX socket APIs for UDP, in which the client accepts a string from the user and sends it to the server. The server will check if the string is palindrome or not and send the result with the length of the string and the number of occurrences of each vowel in the string to the client. The client displays the received data on the client screen. The process repeats until user enter the string “Halt”. Then both the processes terminate. (The program should make use of TCP and UDP separately).
 # Additional Exercise:
 1. Write two separate C programs (one for the Server and the other for Client) using UNIX socket APIs using both connection oriented and connectionless services, in which the server displays the client’s socket address, IP address and port number on the server screen.
