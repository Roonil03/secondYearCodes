# Lab exercises
1. Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations on linked list.
    - Insert an element before another element in the existing list
    - Insert an element after another element in the existing list
    - Delete a given element from the list
    - Traverse the list
    - Reverse the list
    - Sort the list
    - Delete every alternate node in the list
    - Insert an element in a sorted list such that the order is maintained.

# Additional Questions:
1. Write recursive functions for
    - Creating a linked list
    - Traversing a linked list
2. Let X = (x1, x2….xn) and Y = (y1, y2….yn) be 2 linked lists. Assume that, in each list, 
the nodes are in non-decreasing order of the data field values. Write an algorithm to merge two lists to obtain a new linked list Z in which the nodes are also in the non-decreasing order. Following the merge, X and Y do not exist as individual lists. Each node initially in X or Y is now in Z. Do not use additional nodes.
3. Let list1 = (x1, x2…..xn) and list2= (y1, y2…..ym). Write a function to merge list1 and list2 to obtain list3 = (x1, y1, x2, y2….xm,ym,xm+1…xn) for m<=n; and list3=(x1,y1,x2,y2…..xn, yn, xn+1….xm) for m>n.
4. Write a program to implement stack & queue using Singly linked lists.
