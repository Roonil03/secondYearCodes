# Lab exercises
1. Write user defined functions to perform the following operations on binary trees.
    - In order traversal (Iterative)
    - Post order traversal (Iterative)
    - Preorder traversal(Iterative)
    - Print the parent of the given element
    - Print the depth of the tree
    - Print the ancestors of a given element
    - Count the number of leaf nodes in a binary tree

2. Write a recursive function to 
- Create a binary tree
- Print a binary tree

# Additional exercise:
