# Lab Questions:
1. Write an assembly program to sort an array using selection sort
2. Write an assembly program to find the factorial of a unsigned number using recursion
3. Write an assembly program to search an element in an array of ten 32 bit numbers using linear search.
# Additional Exercise
1. Assume that ten 32 bit numbers are stored in registers R0-R10. Sort these numbers in the fully ascending stack using selection sort and store the sorted array back into the registers. Use STM and LDMDB instructions wherever necessary.
2. Repeat the above question (4) for fully descending stack using STMDB and LDM instruction wherever necessary.
